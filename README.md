AWS Design Patterns Interview Questions

The choice of design pattern for a Node.js Lambda function in AWS depends on the specific requirements and use case of your function. Here are a few design patterns that are commonly used with Lambda functions:

1. **Simple Handler Function Pattern**: This is the most basic pattern. Your Lambda function consists of a single handler function that is executed when the Lambda is triggered. This pattern is suitable for small, straightforward tasks.

2. **Serverless Microservices Pattern**: If you're building a serverless microservice architecture, you can create multiple Lambda functions, each responsible for a specific part of your application. This promotes modularity and scalability.

3. **Event Sourcing Pattern**: In this pattern, you use Lambda functions to process and react to events from various sources (e.g., S3, SNS, SQS, etc.). This is helpful when you want to build event-driven systems.

4. **Singleton Pattern**: If you need to ensure that there's only one instance of a resource or service, you can use the Singleton pattern within your Lambda function. For example, if you want to establish a single, long-lived database connection, you can manage it using the Singleton pattern.

5. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: For functions that interact with external services, you might consider implementing a Circuit Breaker pattern to handle failures gracefully and avoid overloading the service.

6. **Factory Pattern**: If your Lambda function needs to create different types of objects based on certain conditions, you can use the Factory pattern to encapsulate object creation and make your code more maintainable.

7. **Dependency Injection Pattern**: To improve testability and maintainability, you can use the Dependency Injection pattern to inject dependencies (like database connections, third-party APIs) into your Lambda function.

8. **State Machine Pattern**: For more complex workflows or stateful processing, AWS Step Functions can be used in combination with Lambda to create a state machine pattern.
